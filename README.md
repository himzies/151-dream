first attempt at web scraping

## motivations
i am a huge pokemon fan and i like collecting pokemon cards! in 2023, japan released a new pokemon card set for the original 151 pokemon, which became a very popular set of cards for collectors like me. the reason for it's popularity is because normally, one card only has two version: one non-foil and one foiled.

![non-foil](https://github.com/himzies/151-dream/blob/main/images/charmander_non-foil.jpg?raw=true)
![normal foil](https://github.com/himzies/151-dream/blob/main/images/charmander_pokeball.jpg?raw=true)
![masterball foil](https://github.com/himzies/151-dream/blob/main/images/charmander_masterball.jpg?raw=true)

for this new set, the (crazy/lucrative) japanese people decided to add a new foiled version with masterball prints in the background. to make matters worst, there exists **only** one masterball card in an entire booster box. if you think that is bad, wait till you hear this... the msrp is around sgd$60 but it is marked up to around **sgd$200** due to its popularity and being out of stock everywhere. it is clear that if i would like to collect everything, i would have to buy them singly instead of purchasing an entire booster box just to get one, which could be a duplicate.

so by now, i hope you get an idea of how costly it would bse if i were to collect this entire set. at the time i am writing this the cheapest masterball card costs around sgd$25 for the likes of less popular pokemon like zubat. this can go up to around sgd$600 for, you guessed it, pikachu...

what i am planning to do is to purchase 1-3 of these bad boys every month (preferably at a low price) and hopefully by the end of 5-10 years, i would have **CAUGHT THEM ALL**! at the same time, i would like to track their market prices on a daily level and compare them to the price i bought them at. price reference for japanese trading cards are often on a popular japanese website called [遊々亭](https://yuyu-tei.jp/) which is the website that i will be attempting to scrape.
